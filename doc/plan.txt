I have too many things to organise and I want to be able to have multiple todo lists!

1. see my todo lists overview
2. make a new todo list
3. modify (rename) a todo list
4. remove todo lists


integrate todo items into todo lists

1. todo items must belong to a todo list
2. clicking on a todo list will show you its items
3. adding and 'completing' items on todo lists
4. removing a list (will delete all its items)


Goal? Objective? Theme? Pursuit? Aim? Target? Aspiration? Motive? Inspiration? Purpose?

Aspiration
-----------

Things you would like to be able to do that are themselves not suitable for
direct decomposition. e.g. Learn language, get better at Art, learn an instrument.

1. see aspirations
2. add new aspiration
3. edit aspiration
4. remove aspiration


ProgressLog
------

Given that aspirations guide todo_lists i would like to keep a log of the 
progress made each day.

1. see day log
2. add day log (cant post multiple day logs for same day)
3. purge day logs?
