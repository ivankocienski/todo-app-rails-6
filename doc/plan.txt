A todo list

a todo item is an entity holding
- description
- completed
- time it was created

1. see pending items
2. see all items
3. add new item
4. mark item complete


todo_lists
  - name

I have too many things to organise and I want to be able to have multiple todo lists!

1. see my todo lists overview
2. make a new todo list
3. modify (rename) a todo list
4. remove todo lists


integrate todo items into todo lists

1. todo items must belong to a todo list
2. clicking on a todo list will show you its items
3. adding and 'completing' items on todo lists
4. removing a list (will delete all its items)


Goal? Objective? Theme? Pursuit? Aim? Target? Aspiration? Motive? Inspiration? Purpose?

Aspiration
-----------

Things you would like to be able to do that are themselves not suitable for
direct decomposition. e.g. Learn language, get better at Art, learn an instrument.

1. see aspirations
2. add new aspiration
3. edit aspiration
4. remove aspiration


ProgressLog
-----------

Given that aspirations guide todo_lists i would like to keep a log of the 
progress made each day.

1. see day log
2. add day log (cant post multiple day logs for same day)
3. purge day logs?



error feedback
- todo list (create, update)
- todo item (create)
- aspiration (create, update)



## Tying aspirations to todo lists or todo items to progress logs


Todo list logging progress 
--------------------------

as a user i would like to log progress on a specific todo list item.
this way i can see which items i am working on in the progress log and
i can see how much a todo item has been worked on.

1. when creating progress log, reference todo item.
2. seeing a progress log details
3. seeing the logged progress on todo_items


- resource not found
  on show/edit views when a resource is not found
  render a 'resource' not found page with 404 status.
  at the moment some actions use redirects, which is
  not RESTful resource spec
  - todo_list
  - aspirations
  - todo_items
  - progress_logs


styling
-------

To make the site more usable better styling and layout needs to be
considered. This will aid users in understanding what they are 
looking at and help them understand any errors they need to address.

- in general
  - flash
  - forms
  - form errors
  - form hints
  - lists
  
- on resources
  - aspirations
    - edit, index, new, show
  - todo_lists
    - edit, index, new, show
  - todo_items
    - edit, new, show
  - progress_logs
    - index, new, show
