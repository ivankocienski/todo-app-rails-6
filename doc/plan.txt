A todo list

a todo item is an entity holding
- description
- completed
- time it was created

1. see pending items
2. see all items
3. add new item
4. mark item complete


todo_lists
  - name

I have too many things to organise and I want to be able to have multiple todo lists!

1. see my todo lists overview
2. make a new todo list
3. modify (rename) a todo list
4. remove todo lists


integrate todo items into todo lists

1. todo items must belong to a todo list
2. clicking on a todo list will show you its items
3. adding and 'completing' items on todo lists
4. removing a list (will delete all its items)


Goal? Objective? Theme? Pursuit? Aim? Target? Aspiration? Motive? Inspiration? Purpose?

Aspiration
-----------

Things you would like to be able to do that are themselves not suitable for
direct decomposition. e.g. Learn language, get better at Art, learn an instrument.

1. see aspirations
2. add new aspiration
3. edit aspiration
4. remove aspiration


ProgressLog
-----------

Given that aspirations guide todo_lists i would like to keep a log of the 
progress made each day.

1. see day log
2. add day log (cant post multiple day logs for same day)
3. purge day logs?



error feedback
- todo list (create, update)
- todo item (create)
- aspiration (create, update)



## Tying aspirations to todo lists or todo items to progress logs


Todo list logging progress 
--------------------------

as a user i would like to log progress on a specific todo list item.
this way i can see which items i am working on in the progress log and
i can see how much a todo item has been worked on.

1. when creating progress log, reference todo item.
2. seeing a progress log details
3. seeing the logged progress on todo_items


- resource not found
  on show/edit views when a resource is not found
  render a 'resource' not found page with 404 status.
  at the moment some actions use redirects, which is
  not RESTful resource spec
  - todo_list
  - aspirations
  - todo_items
  - progress_logs


styling
-------

To make the site more usable better styling and layout needs to be
considered. This will aid users in understanding what they are 
looking at and help them understand any errors they need to address.

- in general
  - flash
  - forms
  - form errors
  - lists
  
- on resources
  - aspirations
    - edit, index, new, show
  - todo_lists
    - edit, index, new, show
  - todo_items
    - edit, new, show
  - progress_logs
    - index, new, show


form hints
----------

users should be able to see what is required for input boxes



flow through
------------

So now I have built the basic models and views surrounding the problem domain
work must proceed onto 'flow' through the application where the front end
needs to be worked on to make the site actually usable by a user in the way
it is intended.

Can I add goals?
Can I make todo lists?
Can I make todo items?
Can I mark todo items done?
Can I log progress?

Not in a "does the site do this?" way but in a "How should this be done to
make the user's life easier?" way.

What is it that users should be doing the most on the site?
(how can we streamline this?)

What is it that users should be doing infrequently on the site?
(how can this be done easiest?)




Flow work
---------

Aspirations: An aspiration has a Title, Subject(?), Description and Goal.

1- Title: One sentence summarising description like "Improve Life Drawing"

1- Description: Expansion and scoping of Title: Draw lots of people


2- Subject: Used for tying Aspirations together. Like a subject of the aspiration. So e.g. "Art"

2- Goal: The thing you will have produced to indicate success. e.g. 10 drawings in my art book.

2- Follow on: The previous aspiration that led to this one (optional)


3- State:
  - waiting_for_start
  - in_progress
  - complete
  - parked
  - discarded

4- maybe drop description and put in "goal" and "requirements" ?
