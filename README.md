# Rails 6 Application

An application built with the latest (for November 2020) rails 6 framework. Use of TDD and BDD methodologies to prove correctness.

This project was an excersize to walk through the development cycle of a new rails app. High level specifications where sketched out in `doc/plan.txt` that where then used to build feature specs that led to low level specs. Code for the low level specs was written and by so doing the feature specs where themselves made to pass.
